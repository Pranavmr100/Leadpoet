LeadPoet Subnet - Decentralized Lead Generation on Bittensor
Welcome to LeadPoet, a Bittensor subnet designed to create a decentralized, privacy-compliant lead generation network. Contributors submit lead lists, validators ensure quality, and buyers access tailored leads via API or UI—all powered by the TAO token ecosystem.
Overview
LeadPoet leverages Bittensor’s decentralized architecture and IPFS for off-chain storage to deliver a scalable, incentivized lead marketplace. Contributors earn TAO rewards for high-quality submissions, validators maintain integrity, and buyers access leads for sales and marketing.
Nodes: Contributors (submit leads), Validators (assess quality), Buyers (purchase leads).

Data Flow: Encrypted lead lists → Validator scoring → On-chain storage → API/UI access.

Token: TAO for staking, rewards, and purchases.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Hardware: 16GB RAM, 4-core CPU, 100GB SSD.

Software: Bittensor CLI, Python 3.9+, IPFS client.

TAO Wallet: Required for staking and transactions.

Installation
Install Bittensor:
bash

pip install bittensor

Set up IPFS:
bash

ipfs init
ipfs daemon

Clone this repo:
bash

git clone https://github.com/[your-repo]/leadpoet-subnet.git
cd leadpoet-subnet

For Contributors
How to Participate
Register with a TAO wallet and stake at least 8 TAO.

Prepare your lead list in JSON format:
json

{
  "leads": [
    {"email": "user@example.com", "industry": "SaaS"}
  ],
  "metadata": {"region": "US"}
}

Encrypt and submit via API:
bash

curl -X POST -d @leads.json http://subnet-api/submit_leads

Check status:
bash

curl http://subnet-api/validation_status?submission_id=<your_submission_id>

Incentives
Earn TAO based on validated leads and quality score (80-100).

Formula: (Your Validated Leads * Quality Score) / Total Emissions = Your % of Block Rewards.

Tips: Ensure valid emails and compliance (e.g., GDPR anonymization).

For Buyers
Accessing Leads
Get a TAO wallet and tokens.

Via UI:
Visit leadpoet.com.

Filter by industry/region, pay with USD or TAO.

Via API:
bash

curl -X GET "http://subnet-api/leads?industry=SaaS&region=US" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TAO_wallet_key>"

Output: Decrypted JSON list (e.g., [{"email": "user@example.com", "industry": "SaaS"}]) .

Export to CRM (e.g., Salesforce) with export_to_salesforce.py.

Pricing Example
100 SaaS leads = 2 TAO.
